# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Overview

The Rule Engine with AST is a flexible and extensible framework designed to evaluate business rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This project allows users to define rules in a structured manner and evaluate them against input data, making it suitable for various applications such as validation, filtering, and decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rule Evaluation**: Easily define and evaluate rules dynamically at runtime.
- **Extensible**: Add custom functions and operators to enhance the rule engine's capabilities.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple syntax for defining rules that can be easily understood and modified.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient evaluation of rules using AST for faster processing.

## Installation

To install the Rule Engine with AST, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Xspidy7/RuleEngineWithAst.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RuleEngineWithAst
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To use the Rule Engine, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Engine**:
   ```javascript
   const RuleEngine = require('./path/to/ruleEngine');  // Update to the correct path
   ```

2. **Define Rules**: Create rules using a simple syntax. For example:
   ```javascript
   const rules = [
       { condition: 'age > 18', action: 'allow' },
       { condition: 'age <= 18', action: 'deny' }
   ];
   ```

3. **Evaluate Rules**: Pass the input data to the engine for evaluation:
   ```javascript
   const inputData = { age: 20 };
   const result = RuleEngine.evaluate(rules, inputData);
   console.log(result); // Output: 'allow'
   ```

## Architecture

The Rule Engine is built on a modular architecture that consists of the following components:

- **Parser**: Converts rule definitions into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
- **Evaluator**: Traverses the AST to evaluate conditions and execute actions based on the rules.
- **Context**: Holds the input data and provides it to the evaluator for processing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to the Rule Engine, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Running Tests

If you have tests written for your Rule Engine, you can run them using:
```bash
npm test
```
```
